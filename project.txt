what is parkinson disease ?
Parkinson disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance and coordination.

data -> preprocess -> train test split -> svm
new data -> trained svm  -> disease or not (prediction)

MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency * MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy
RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent * spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation
